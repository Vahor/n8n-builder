# TODO:

- Add more nodes (check if we can generate them)
- Add more examples (with screenshots)
- Add README.md in each package
- Add more tests ( and type tests)
- Call to subworkflow with correct input parameters.
- Add a way to deploy from the terminal (needs API KEY, an app is a list of things to deploy)

- Add CONTRIBUTING.md

- When importing a workflow we get `Node does not have any credentials set`
- Add a proper logger, that can handle prefix for `[dry-run]`, maybe colors, etc.

## Tests to add:

- Propagate types for if nodes
