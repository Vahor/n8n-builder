# TODO:

- Add more nodes (check if we can generate them)
- Add more examples (with screenshots)
- Add more tests ( and type tests)
- Call to subworkflow with correct input parameters.
- Add a way to deploy from the terminal (needs API KEY, an app is a list of things to deploy)
- I don't really like the `unlinkedNodes` property name.

- Add credentials references
- Add a way to deploy credentials
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md

- When importing a workflow we get `Node does not have any credentials set`

## Tests to add:

- Propagate types for if nodes
